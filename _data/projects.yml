- title: "IoT4Ag: The Internet of Things for Precision Agriculture"
  sponsor: National Science Foundation (NSF)
  year: 2021 &mdash; Present
  summary: Our Mission is to create and translate to practice Internet of Thing (IoT) technologies for precision agriculture and to train and educate a diverse workforce that will address the societal grand challenge of food, energy, and water security for decades to come. In this research, I am focusing on developing autonomous ground-based robot which can navigate autonomously and do physical sampling for crop analysis in large-scale cornfields.

- title: Development of High Definition Map for Autonomous Vehicles Update Technology
  sponsor: SK Telecom
  year: 2019 &mdash; 2021
  summary: "Our goal was to develop a technology that keeps high definition (HD) maps for autonomous vehicles up to date by using a large amount of low-cost low-quality crowdsourced data. I designed two main algorithms for various types of landmarks in the road environment by MATLAB and C++: Observation Learner module and Landmark Update module. My methods make it possible to determine which landmarks need to be registered in the updated maps. Throughout this project, I could realize the importance of accurate map management in the field of autonomous driving."
