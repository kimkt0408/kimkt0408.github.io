- title: "IoT4Ag: The Internet of Things for Precision Agriculture"
  sponsor: National Science Foundation (NSF)
  year: 2021 &mdash; Present
  summary: Our Mission is to create and translate to practice Internet of Thing (IoT) technologies for precision agriculture and to train and educate a diverse workforce that will address the societal grand challenge of food, energy, and water security for decades to come. In this research, I am focusing on developing autonomous ground-based robot which can navigate autonomously and do physical sampling for nutrition analysis in large-scale cornfields.
